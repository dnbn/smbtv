LONDON, Oct. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Alfresco Software, Inc., the leader in
 open source enterprise content management (ECM), today announced that it is
 now offering Alfresco JLAN, formerly known as the Alfresco Intelligent File
 System, under the GNU Public License (GPL), the world's most popular open
 source software license.
     GPL is the most widely used free software license worldwide; almost
 three quarters of all free software and open source programs are
 distributed under this license. Alfresco adopted GPL licensing for the rest
 of its open source enterprise content management software earlier this
 year.
     Alfresco JLAN is a unique implementation of an embedded virtual file
 system that offers the only Java client and server implementation of
 Microsoft Window's CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocol, allowing
 content, system administration information, and rows in a database to
 appear as a shared drive. The shared drive is the de-facto document
 management interface for the vast majority of computer users today.
     Alfresco JLAN offers the following features and functionality:
      *  Only Pure Java client and server implementation -- CIFS, NFS and FTP
      *  High Performance -- Similar to the native file system
      *  Enterprise Authentication -- NTLM, NTLMSSP, SPNEGO, Kerberos/AD
      *  Real-Time Access -- No copy-to-local disk or conflict resolution
         issues
      *  Offline Access -- Integration to Microsoft(R) briefcase
     Last spring, Alfresco offered JLAN, which was previously incorporated
 within Alfresco Enterprise Content Management Server, as a standalone
 embeddable option for OEMs. The availability of Alfresco JLAN as an OEM
 license enables partners to add JLAN features and functionality to their
 products rapidly and at much lower cost. Alfresco JLAN customers include
 Avaki EII (owned by Sybase), Caringo, EMC Documentum and Veritas (owned by
 Symantec). These companies are using Alfresco JLAN for shared drive
 interfaces to content management systems, databases, or content enabling
 applications such as customer relationship management.
     "I am very excited about this open source contribution," said Chris
 Hertel, Samba Team member and co-founder the jCIFS project. "Every open
 source CIFS implementation adds to the community's understanding, and to
 the utility of the protocol itself."
     "Alfresco JLAN has allowed us to expand our OEM momentum with a simple
 interface and low cost open source solution, which can be embedded easily
 into various systems," said John Newton, CTO, Alfresco Software. "Today,
 more than 50 customers, including some of the largest software companies in
 the world, have already incorporated Alfresco JLAN into their products."
     Alfresco is the leading open source alternative for Enterprise Content
 Management and the first embeddable ECM system. It is being used by leading
 original equipment manufacturers, independent software vendors (ISVs) and
 value added resellers (VARs). Alfresco has been downloaded more than
 700,000 times, has 25,000 live sites and 300 customers, predominantly from
 the Global 2000. An embedded version of Alfresco has been available since
 October 2005.
